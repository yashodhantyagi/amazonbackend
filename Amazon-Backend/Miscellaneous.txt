MongoDB

=> is a no SQL database.
=> No restriction => doc, graph, geo location formats are allowed.

Pros:
No need to keep things NULL, just keep things that have data and skip the ones which may have NULL

Cons:
Not present data that exists in some other record.

Horizontal => Multiple computers process together
Vertical => Each Computer has to have enough power to process data

Vertical: scaling is expensive but easily maintained
Mutiplie: when data is to be distributed.

Digital Ocean, SQLite, AWS provides DB

Q. NoSQL vs SQL?

Mostly BSON things in NoSQL => JSON + datatype

You are able to define what type of entry is allowed or Not
DB: Atlas??

In mongoose, you have schema
example schema:

{
    name: string,
    age: number
}

=> It creates Models, which creates objects/Documents
